# FAQ

### Is there a dynmap?
Yes, we do have a dynmap, and it is available at [map.fortressmc.cf](https://map.fortressmc.cf/)

### Is the server PTW?
No! We are strongly against PTW ranks. All of our ranks are cosmetic only, and money recieved from ranks go directly to the server. If you have any questions on what we are using the money for, feel free to ask as we try to be transparent about the matter.

### How do you earn money?
There are two entry points into the economy: Diamonds and Jobs. Diamonds can be sold for $100 each using `/sell diamond` or `/sell hand` if you hold them. Jobs is a plugin that allows you to "join" a job, and earn money for doing the specified tasks. More info on jobs can be found by doing `/jobs browse`.

### What does /vote do?
`/vote` opens a GUI allows you to see what sites you've voted at in the past 24 hours, and clicking on each option will give you a link to the site in chat that you can click on. Each site gives you one voting point, which you can spend on crate keys by doing `/voteshop` or `/votegui`. You can view and open crates at `/warp crates`.

### What warps are there?
There are several warps. Here is a list of the current warps:
- `/warp Spawn` - Warps you to the spawn world
- `/warp EarthSpawn` Warps you to the main world's (Earth's) spawn
- `/warp Event` - Warps you to the events tower in the spawn world
- `/warp Crates` - Warps you to the crates tower in the spawn world
- `/warp ResourceSpawn` - Warps you to the resource world's spawn
- `/warp EndSpawn` - Warps you to the spawn in the end

### Is there a PVP Arena?
Yes, at `/warp Arena` there is a PVP arena. You also will not lose items as keep inventory is on in the spawn world.

### How can I sell items?
Items can be sold multiple ways. The first option is to sell them on `/ah`. You can list an item by holding it in your hand, then running the command `/ah sell <amount>`. `<ammount>` Is the ammount of money you want to sell the item for. The second option is a sigh shop. To create a sign shop, place a chest then put the item you wish to sell in the chest. Then, place a sign on the chest adn write the following:    

**Line 1:** Leave Blank     
**Line 2:** The amount of items you want to sell (Ex. If you want to sell 32 of an item, write 32)      
**Line 3:** `B<value> S<value>` - `B` represents a player buying an item, meaning you are selling the item and getting money. `S` represents a player selling an item, meaning you are paying them money for them to give you the item. `<value>` is the ammount of money you want to sell/buy an item for. If you want the value to be free, write `FREE` instead of `0`.      
**Line 4:** `<item id>` - This can either be its numeric id, or its id as a string. You can also do a `?` to make the server automatically detect and write the item's ID on a sign. Note that for a `?` to work you must only have 1 type of item in the chest.
