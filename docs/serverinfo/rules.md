# Server Rules

We enforce these rules via a tier system. Each rule is categorized into a tier based on how extreme it is, and each tier has its own set of punishments. There are also different sections of our rules, with each section dealing with different subjects. When staff talks about a rule, it should be referenced as Section.Tier.Rule. For example, Rule 1 of the 2nd tier of section A would be called Rule A.2.1.

Here are some things to keep in mind:
- While the punishments are defined, some cases may be irregular and result in a punishment that differs from the ones stated below.
- Loopholes are considered infractions as well, and will result in the same punishment if the rule was broken normally.
- Ban and/or Mute evasion is strictly prohibited, and will result in the alt account being banned for 30 days and the main account having the punishment length doubled.
- The rules are constantly changing, so make sure to stay up to date with them. Also, remember that all infractions prior to a rule's creation will not be enforced, unless the infraction is deemed extreme enough to be punishable by staff.

# Section A - Serverwide rules (In-game and in Discord) for All Players

### Tier 1

1. **No Advertising**   
    Advertising is classified as anything that promotes another Minecraft server, a discord server, etc. It does not include advertising matter involving something in-game, such as advertising your shop or auction listing, unless you are excessively advertising or spamming. This rule is enforced when advertising happens in chat, is written on a sign, made with pixel art and/or blocks to spell words or make a logo, or when an advertisement is made via mapart. The exception to this rule is of a player consents to you sending them information that could be classified as an advertisement.

2. **Excessive Swearing**   
    This rule is simple. Don't swear every other word. You can still swear, but if over 50% of the words you are saying are swear words, you will be in violatiuon of this rule.

3. **Spamming**     
    Spamming is classified as sending the same message 3 or more times in sequence, with little to no time in-between sending the messages.

4. **Discussion of Sensitive/Controversial Topics**     
    We don't want this in chat, on signs, or anywhere on the server. This server is not the place to talk politics.

5. **Do not beg or ask server staff for you or someone else to recieve any of the following:**     
    - OP
    - Items
    - Ranks
    - Staff position
    - Staff promotion   

6. **Do not argue with staff about punishments.**   
    If you have an issue with your punishment, create a ticket. Arguing over someone else's punishment is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate enforcement of the punishments for this tier.

7. **No racist or sexist remarks**  
    Again, common courtesy. Do not make others feel uncomfortable. Hate speech and Extremism (Ex, Nazism) is strictly prohibited.

8. **No controversial naming of tools, weapons, armor, etc.**    
    Keep it safe for work. All chat rules also apply to the naming of your gear.

9. **Obey staff law**   
    Staff dictates the outcome of conflict and rule breaking. It is not up to the normal player to decide, nor should players be deciding what other players are allowed to do.

10. **Respect server staff.**   
    They aren't here to make enemies or conflict. Don't ping spam, yell at, or be rude to staff. Also, unless you have legitimate proof to show that a staff member is abusing their power, dont just say "Staff abuse" in chat. All it does is make the situation worse for everyone.

11. **No Hate Speech (Race, Sex, Orientation, Gender, Nationality, etc).**  

12. **Discussing how to Cheat is prohibited.**

13. **Outright lying to server staff is not allowed.**

# Section C - Wartime Rules

This section does not have a tier system, as it is guidelines on wartime, not sepcific rules.   

- **All rules apply during wartime. However, Rules A.2.2, A.2.4, and A.2.10 are not enforced during wartime.**  
- **There is a 7 day grace period between wars. Here are the rules of a grace period:** 
    - Towns and/or nations involved with the previous war are not allowed to war again between themselves. This means that 2 or more towns and/or nations that went to war can not declare war on each other again for 7 days. This also means that even if your town and/or nation was involved in a war less than 7 days ago, you can still declare war on (a) different town(s) and/or nation(s) than the town(s) and/or nations(s) you were just at war with.
    - During a grace period, all forms of PVP are allowed, (so long as they obey all other server rules) no matter if it is with players that opposed you previously during a war.

- **If you have access to creative or /give, do not spawn in items and/or money for players, or give players "illegal" items. Also, if you help players with building, only use legitimate items/blocks.**
